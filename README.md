### My first WordPress site/theme built from scratch.
---

Unlike other WordPress themes, this one was not built to be used across any website, and in fact has custom pages designed and coded for the website author.

This site was an experiment in WordPress and PHP. Anything that is not a wordPress function was custom code developed by the frontend developer (@booellean).

In short, this a small experiment in WordPress and PHP. Fixes will be implemented to make it more cross browser compatible as time goes on.
