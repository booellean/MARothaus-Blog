		<p>I’m currently working at a commercial Food and Environmental Science laboratory, but I have a wide array of professional interests. From urban agriculture to island ecology, I’m interested in how people interact with plants and ecosystems. More recently I’ve become interested in issues of food safety and how containments end up in what we eat. </p>
