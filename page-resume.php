		<div class="row">
			<div class="resume-paragraph">
				Designed and implemented a survey of water quality in the Narbeck Wetland Sanctuary. Samples were taken from five separate ponds that are hydrologically connected through leaky berms, but are otherwise separate. After collection samples were analyzed in a lab for five water quality parameters (alkalinity, temperature, conductivity, turbidly, and pH). Linear regressions were used to look for patterns in the data across the five ponds.

				Two weeks exploring the Galapagos Archipelago. Studied a wide variety of ecosystems and how various organizations were performing conservation biology. Interacted with locals to learn how they viewed their environment and what they considered important.<br>
				Four days exploring Cloud Forest in mountains of Ecuador under field guide Nelson Jaramillo. Discussed plant communities and how they interact with wildlife to form a unique ecosystem.

				Worked within a team to develop and perform a study on the extent of earthworm invasion in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Study included collecting worm specimens, soils samples, leaf litter, and assessing percent plant coverage of sample sites. Used R statistical software to perform both analysis of variants (ANOVAs) and Structural Equation Modeling to analyze the collected data.
